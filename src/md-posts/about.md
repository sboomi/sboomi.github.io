# About me

I'm a passionate data developer, math tutor, and lifelong self-learner with a strong background in science. I thrive on expanding my knowledge and continuously pushing for independence when it comes to mastering tools and technologies.

Having worked in both startups and large companies, I've honed my ability to adapt and tackle a wide range of challengesâ€”becoming a true jack-of-all-trades. Yet, my heart still leans toward data analysis and engineering, where I love transforming raw data into meaningful insights!
